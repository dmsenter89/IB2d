%
% LAGRANGIAN STRUCTURE / FIBER MODELS
%
1. Fix Lagrangian Pts. passing through boundaries (for periodic domains)
	a. Fixed for springs (linear, non-linear, damped) and 
           beams (torsional, non-invariant) in MATLAB
	b. Need to update similarly in pyIB2d
2. Allow for one than one boundary to be read in

%
% FLUID SOLVER / BLACK-BOX
% 
1. Optimize muscle model force computations
2. Stoke's Fluid Solver
3. Non-Newtonian Fluid Solver ("Power Law Fluid", first)
4. Incorporate Blob Projection method
5. Incorporate Regularized Stokeslets for Stokes Flow
6. Parallelization for both data dumping and mid time-stepping
7. Port electrophysiology code to Python 
8. Port code to Julia 
9. Higher order Advection-Diffusion solver
10.Port coagulation model code to pyIB2d 
11.Port Restart protocol to pyIB2d

%
% EXAMPLES
%
1. Fix muscle model parameters for both types for swimmer
        -Length-Tension/Force-Velocity model
        -3-Element Hill Model / LT-FV model
2. Better coagulation example

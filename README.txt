IB2d is an Immersed Boundary Code (IB) for solving fully coupled non-linear 
 	fluid-structure interaction models. This version of the code is based 
	off of Peskin's Immersed Boundary Method Paper in Acta Numerica, 2002.

This code is capable of creating Lagrangian Structures using:
 	1. Springs (* linear, non-linear, damped *)
 	2. Beams (*torsional springs or non-invariant beams *)
 	3. Target Points
	4. Muscle-Model 1 (combined Force-Length-Velocity model with a 
                        Hill (i.e.,Length-Tension) Model )
        5. 3-Element Hill Muscle (combined 3-element hill mode coupled w/
                        Force-Velocity/Length-Tension Model)
        6. Mass Points (with or without influence of gravity)
        7. Porous Structures (via Darcy’s Law) 
        8. Electrophysiology (FitzHugh-Nagumo coupling w/ or w/o calcium
			dynamics and w/ or w/o muscle models)
	9. Non-invariant Beams
	10. User-defined deformation laws
        11. Poroelastic Media (based on Brinkman-like forces)
        12. Coagulation / Aggregation models

One is able to update those Lagrangian Structure Parameters, e.g., spring constants, resting lengths, etc
 
There are a number of built in Examples (~70), mostly used for teaching purposes. 

If you would like us to add a specific muscle model, please contact Nick (nickabattista@gmail.edu) 

If you use this code for the purposes of teaching, research, or recreation please let Nick know as well :)

    the direction of gravitational influence in any direction you'd wish, 
    in input2d

-You can have a background concentration gradient that is advected and diffused
    via the background flow.

-You can use the Boussinesq approximation

-It can plot the following things in Matlab, if plot_Matlab flag = 1 in input2d:
    a. Vorticity (colormap) + Lagrangian Pts.

-There are flags in input2d for the printing interval between saving data
        -> print_Dump

-There are flags in input2d whether you'd like Matlab to plot various 
    quantities as simulation progresses:

            -> plot_Matlab     (set = 1, if yes, have Matlab plot)
            -> plot_<Quantity> (set = 1, if yes for quantity)
